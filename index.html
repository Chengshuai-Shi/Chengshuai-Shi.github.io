<h2>Research Interest</h2>
<p>My current research focuses on <b>multi-armed bandits</b> (MAB) problems and more general <b>reinforcement learning</b> problems. I also have broad interests in <b>distributed learning</b> and <b>federated learning</b>.</p>
<p>Some of my ongoing research projects are</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Decentralized multi-player MAB (MP-MAB)</b>: The MP-MAB problem, in which multiple players simultaneously play the bandit game in a fully decentralized fashion and interact through arm collisions, has sparked significant interest in recent years. I have introduced information-theoretical tools, e.g., error correction/detection coding and Z-channel model, into the study of no-sensing MP-MAB, where collisions are not perceivable by players (<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/shi20a.html">stochastic</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01090">adversarial</a>). Currently, I am working on opening the methodological door between MP-MAB and combinatorial MAB.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Federated MAB (FMAB)</b>: Federated learning (FL) is an emerging and promising distributed machine learning paradigm. While the current FL studies are mostly focused on supervised learning, I proposed to extend core principles in FL into the study of MAB, and am actively working on this new bandit paradigm (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12204">paper</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13101">paper</a>).</p>
