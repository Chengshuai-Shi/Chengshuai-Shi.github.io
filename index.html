<h2>Research Interest</h2>
<p>My current research focuses on <b>multi-armed bandits</b> (MAB) problems and more general <b>reinforcement learning</b> problems. I also have broad interests in <b>distributed learning</b> and <b>federated learning</b>.</p>
<p>Some of my past and ongoing research projects are</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Decentralized multi-player MAB (MP-MAB)</b>: The MP-MAB problem, in which multiple players simultaneously play the bandit game in a fully decentralized fashion and interact through arm collisions, has sparked significant interest in recent years. We have introduced information-theoretical tools, e.g., error correction/detection coding and Z-channel model, into the study of no-sensing MP-MAB, where collisions are not perceivable by players (<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/shi20a.html">stochastic</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01090">adversarial</a>). Recently, we have utilized the connection between MP-MAB and combinatorial MAB to close the performance gap in <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/bcb3303a96a92dc38c12992941de7627-Abstract.html">heterogeneous MP-MAB</a> and perform further generalization.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Federated MAB (FMAB)</b>: Federated learning (FL) is an emerging and promising distributed machine learning paradigm. While the current FL studies are mostly focused on supervised learning, we proposed to extend core principles in FL into the study of MAB, and are actively working on this new bandit paradigm (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12204">paper</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13101">paper</a>).</p>
