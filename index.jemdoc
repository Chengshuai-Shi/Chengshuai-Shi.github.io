About this picture: My mother drew this Dr. Cat wearing a graduation cap when I was in high school. Now I am working towards a Ph.D. and hopefully, my family can see me wearing it one day:)

*Since Fall 2021, I have been supported by the generous [https://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/announcing-bloomberg-data-science-ph-d-fellowship-winners-2021-2022 Bloomberg Data Science Ph.D. fellowship].*

== Research Interest
I am interested in general machine learning research, and am actively exploring topics related to *foundation models*, especially *in-context learning*. My past research was focused on *multi-armed bandits* (MAB) and *reinforcement learning* (RL) problems, especially their multi-agent versions. I also have broad interests in *distributed learning* and *federated learning*.

#Some of my past and ongoing research projects are
#- *Decentralized multi-player MAB (MP-MAB)*: The MP-MAB problem, in which multiple players simultaneously play the bandit game in a fully decentralized fashion and interact through arm collisions, has sparked significant interest in recent years. We have introduced information-theoretical tools, e.g., error correction/detection coding and Z-channel model, into the study of no-sensing MP-MAB, where collisions are not perceivable by players ([http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/shi20a.html stochastic], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01090 adversarial]). Recently, we have utilized the connection between MP-MAB and combinatorial MAB to close the performance gap in [https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/bcb3303a96a92dc38c12992941de7627-Abstract.html heterogeneous MP-MAB] and perform further generalization.
#- *Federated MAB (FMAB)*: Federated learning (FL) is an emerging and promising distributed machine learning paradigm. While the current FL studies are mostly focused on supervised learning, we proposed to extend core principles in FL into the study of MAB, and are actively working on this new bandit paradigm ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12204 paper], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13101 paper]).

#I am currently looking for internships (next spring or summer) in the field of multi-armed bandits and reinforcement learning.
