I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Virginia in 2024, where I was advised by Professor [https://cshen317.github.io/ Cong Shen]. During my Ph.D. (2021–2024), I was honored to be supported by the [https://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/announcing-bloomberg-data-science-ph-d-fellowship-winners-2021-2022 Bloomberg Data Science Ph.D. fellowship].

My research interests lie in machine learning, with a focus on intelligent decision-making. Specifically, I work on:
- Foundational principles in areas such as reinforcement learning, multi-armed bandits, game theory, and multi-agent systems;
- Applications in emerging fields including wireless communication, recommender systems, and large language models
